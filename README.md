# flask-react-template
A ready-to-go template for basic full stack Web applications using Flask and React. Simply:

1) Clone this repo.
2) Spin off a python virtualenv.
3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4) Add your name and the current year to `LICENSE`.
5) `cd` into static and run `npm install`.
6) Add your name and contact, app name, and app description to `package.json`.

Note: `.gitkeep` files have been placed in otherwise empty directories. These exist only to circumvent Git's default behavior of ignoring empty directories; these can safely be deleted.
